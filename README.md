# Classic World of Warcraft Bot for Discord

Discord bot for linking and searching Classic WoWHead.

## General Use
**wow [command]**

> The bot is called by typing "wow " in front of whatever command you want to call.


---


**wow help**

> The bot will return a list of all available commands to call ("Subcommands").


---


**wow help [subcommand]**

> The bot will give you information on the subcommand's purpose and how to properly call it.


## Classic WoWHead Commands
**wow linkerator "[item name]"**

> Type the name of an item from Classic World of Warcraft and the bot will return its official name, a short description, its icon, and a link to the page from Classic WoWHead. If the bot cannot find the item, or the term searched is not an item (i.e. you type the name of a quest, etc.), then the bot will say that it could not find your item.
**NOTE:** The bot will return the first search result of 5 that most closely matches your search term, so it isn't perfect!


---


**wow find "[search term]"**

> Type the name of a quest, NPC, location, etc. from Classic World of Warcraft and the bot will return the first link from Classic WoWHead.


## Light's Hope Server Commands
**wow status**

> The bot will check the status of the Light's Hope Northdale server to see if it's online, as well as the operational status of all Light's Hope servers.


---


**wow incidents**

> The bot will tell you if any incidents have happened on Light's Hope servers today. If an incident happened, it will provide a link to the status page so you can read it.
